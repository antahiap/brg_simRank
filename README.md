## Graound truth for the simrank

- [x] read d3plot displacements
- [x] one time step, last

  - [x] calcualte the diff
  - [x] all time steps
  - [x] just 5 parts

- [x] Make the todo tasks
- [ ] Compare 3001
  - [x] Simrank matrix value
    - [x] argsort issue with small value, `numpy.array([1., 0.5, 1.]).argsort(kind="heapsort")`
  - [ ] Simrank loop
  - [ ] make feature graph
  - [ ] Pe vs IE weight
    - [ ] why from single to all paired sim differ
    - [ ] Have two different weight
    - [ ] Correct kg01 loading
- [ ] Similarity from RMSE
- [ ] How is it with component graph
- [ ] Diagnoal value not 1
  - [ ] Look in paper
  - [ ] Move the test functions
- [ ] Run simrank for each simulation and ref seprately
- [ ] What does SimRank do
- [ ] Change the spread function
